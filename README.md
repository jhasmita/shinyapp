# Creating my first shiny app
This app has been built as per assignment instructions and requirement.
It is a simple stock visualization tool, that allows end user to punch
a ticker symbol and check historic prices of that stock.

Shiny app utilizes two scripts in this case:
a ui.R script that essentially builds the user interface
a server.R that includes the codes that the app needs to run
at the backhand in order for the user interface to work.
